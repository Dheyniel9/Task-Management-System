Task Management System (Simple Explanation)
===========================================

This is a simple app that helps you keep track of your tasks. You can add new tasks, update them, delete them, and see your list of tasks. It has two main parts:

   Backend: This is like the brain of the app. It uses a tool called Laravel (written in PHP) to handle all the data and rules.
   Frontend: This is what you see and click on. It uses Vue.js to make the app look nice and easy to use.
   Database: All your tasks are saved in a MySQL database, so you don’t lose them.

What Can You Do With This App?
------------------------------

   Sign up and log in
   Add new tasks
   Edit or delete tasks
   See your tasks update in real time

What Do You Need To Run This?
-----------------------------

   PHP (version 8.1 or higher)
   Composer (helps install PHP stuff)
   Node.js and npm (helps run the frontend)
   MySQL (where your tasks are stored)

How To Set It Up (Step by Step)
-------------------------------

 1\. Set Up The Backend (The Brain)

1.  Open your terminal and go to the backend folder:
    
        cd backend
        
    
2.  Copy the example settings file:
    
        cp .env.example .env
        
    
3.  Open the new .env file and fill in your MySQL details:
    
        DBCONNECTION=mysql
        DBHOST=127.0.0.1
        DBPORT=3306
        DBDATABASE=yourdatabase
        DBUSERNAME=yourusername
        DBPASSWORD=yourpassword
        
    
4.  Install the backend tools:
    
        composer install
        
    
5.  Make a special app key:
    
        php artisan key:generate
        
    
6.  Set up the database tables:
    
        php artisan migrate --seed
        
    
7.  Start the backend server:
    
        php artisan serve
        
    

 2\. Set Up The Frontend (What You See)
    

1.  Open your terminal and go to the frontend folder:
    
        cd frontend
        
    
2.  Install the frontend tools:
    
        npm install
        
    
3.  Start the frontend server:
    
        npm run dev
        
    

 3\. How To Test If It Works

   To test the backend:
    
        cd backend
        php artisan test
        
    
   (If you have frontend tests, add them here)
